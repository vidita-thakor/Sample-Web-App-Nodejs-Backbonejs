This web application is built for demonstrating the use of of three web technologies working togather. 

I have used Backbone.js for the frontend, to load the UI elements seamlessly and fast. Backbone.js has many features, which can be useful for the the frontend development.

I have node.js for server-side scripting. It is ideal for writing web services. In this application, the webservice is written to fetch the blog entries and save it to the database.

The another important web technology, which I have utilised in this project is MongoDB. This is a NoSQL database. The Node.js controller connects to to MongoDB client.
